# easy_seq2seq

An implementation of Seq2Seq that actually works. I want to make it easy for people to train their own seq2seq model with any corpus. I am also adding the parameters of my trained model for people to just use it without training. If you have a model that works share your model params here, as external link or do a pull request. I have used Cornell Movie Dialog Corpus to train my model. A link to preprocessed data and scripts for preprocessing can be found in this repo.

*Have Fun!*
